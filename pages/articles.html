	<p class="header">Why I Love to Code</p>
	<p class="post">In practice coding is both an art and a science. A developer needs to master a large amount of technical knowledge in order to create a working application, but the precise implementation can and will vary from developer to developer. Given a non-trivial set of requirements, no two coders will produce the exact same code, even if their technical knowledge is roughly equal. There are multiple ways to skin a cat, and tech people LOVE discussing and arguing the virtues of each method.
	<br><br>
    Much of that debate over code revolves around efficiency. Sure your code works, but does it work well? Can it be made better? There’s always room to make a program run faster and take up less space in memory, and there are numerous approaches to accomplish both of those tasks. But making things better isn’t a linear process: after a certain amount of efficiency is reached (depending, of course, on the technical requirements of the project and the skill of the programmer), the conversation becomes dominated by the tradeoffs involved.
	<br><br>
    Quicksort will usually be faster than mergesort, for example, but mergesort is stable, forcing the programmer to consider what’s more important at this point in time for this project. Different scenarios call for different code implementations, and the hallmark of a competent software engineer is the ability to look at the larger picture and determine code priorities while simultaneously evaluating the pros and cons of all possible approaches. This requires years of practical experience as well as deep technical understanding of all relevant technologies.
    <br><br>
    But even efficiency isn’t everything. It’s worthwhile to abstract this conversation and consider an entire class of tradeoffs a coder will encounter: efficiency vs readability. Let me illustrate this with a Javascript example, which I love for its esotericism: The tilde (~) performs a ‘bitwise complement on its operand’ (NOT), essentially flipping each bit in the binary representation of a number. This ensures that all positive integers (even, or, as we shall see, especially zero) become negative, which are truthy values in Javascript. After this operation, most negative integers become positive (which are truthy, naturally), the sole exception being -1, which becomes zero (a falsy value). Some of you may see where this is going…
    <br><br>
    Using the native Javascript indexOf method to find an element in an array will return the index of that element if it exists in the array, and will return -1 if it doesn’t. So instead of writing ‘if (array.indexOf(elementToLookFor) > -1)…’ you can write the slightly cleaner and slightly faster ‘if (~array.indexOf(elementToLookFor))…’. But no one in their right mind would actually use the tilde in this fashion, due to its obscurity. The performance and code-golf gains here are so minimal that it’s obviously not worth the time it will take for an average (or even above-average) programmer reading this code to figure out what is going on.
    <br><br>
    Most discussions about how to write and structure code aren’t as clear-cut as the awesomely weird example above. That balancing act is where I see the artistic element of coding. Since code readability is so important, the more readable the code is, the better - up to a point, since the technical demands of software almost always require that efficiency be taken into account as well. It can be hard to define what exactly ‘beautiful’ code is, but to me it is highly efficient code that is also easy to understand. In other words, balanced software.
    <br><br>
    One rarely, if ever, approaches this balance on the first try. The disembodied nature of code - easily rearranged characters on a screen - lends itself easily to iteration, a core feature of software development. Get it done, then make it better and repeat. Absolute code perfection is rarely achieved, yet still drives the entire system as something to aspire to. It turns out that software development isn’t so much a technical discipline as it is a process, one that mirrors my own attempts to live perfectly, efficiently and enjoyably.
