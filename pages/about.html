	<p class="header">My Story</p>
	<p class='post'>I've done many things over the past few years. I did undergraduate psychology and pre-law work, as well as graduate studies in Medieval history. For two years I worked as the administrator of an inpatient chemotherapy center for women with breast cancer, and for less then a year as the operations manager for a importer of home goods. But then I discovered coding and web development.
	<br><br>
	I realized my true passion lies in technical problem solving. I recently jumped headfirst into software engineering by attending Fullstack Academy, an immersive coding bootcamp, where I learned Javascript, web development, and the MEAN stack. I also learned to love the process of constantly iterating and refining my code.
	<br><br>
	I am a self-directed, highly motivated individual who relishes challenging assignments and possesses excellent communication skills. I greatly enjoy speaking about and discussing the new things I learn every day. The passion I have for my work always engenders a sense of product ownership, inspiring me further to create great software products, experiences, and code.</p>
